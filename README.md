August_1 
Started the analysis of Metstatic recurrent samples from ICGC (Germline)
Used BSGenome38 and the first error was at Chromosome 2 when switced to HG19 the error was further down (Ch10)
This is a similar problem we had before. 
Will continue HG19 for rest of the analysis

The final sigs input file was generated N X 96 columns. This file will be used to genrate the signatures. 
A total of 127 variants were removed from the data file. That didnot match context. 
The final DF that generated the N X 96 DF was Subset_Mets_Germline_73. 
The deleted data is in Deleted_XLS
